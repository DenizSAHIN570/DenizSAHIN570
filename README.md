# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software developer with about 3 years of experience, specializing in backend development. My journey started with mobile development using Flutter, then expanded into full-stack development, working on EU-backed projects.

### What I Do
- Backend development is my strong suitâ€”it's where I feel most at home, solving complex software problems and building efficient systems.
- I have experience in full-stack development and mobile apps but naturally gravitate towards backend engineering.
- I love seeing my work come to life, especially when building systems that enable others to be more productive.
- I enjoy using Linux, breaking it, and fixing it again. I take the same approach to learningâ€”I like to break and rebuild something before making it better.
- I always strive to write clean and concise code, following best practices to ensure maintainability and efficiency.
- I believe that a good project is partly about code but mostly about solid architecture.
- I see programming languages as toolsâ€”what matters most is how they are used to solve problems effectively.
- I have experience working in enterprise projects in all shapes and sizes.
- I love working with other peopleâ€”teamwork indeed makes the dream work.
- I enjoy mentoring interns and junior developers, helping them grow in their careers.

### Technologies & Skills
- Strong experience and preference for C# and object-oriented programming languages.
- Worked with message brokers such as Kafka and Redis, and with non-relational and OLAP databases including MongoDB and ClickHouse.
- Comfortable with Docker and Docker Compose, and experienced in deployment workflows.
- Experience in infrastructure maintenance, including server provisioning and management.
- Worked on complex projects with disciplined use of Git and adherence to branching and version control best practices.

### Interests & Fun Facts
- Sci-fi and technology have always been passions of mine â€” you can always find me talking about either.
- Iâ€™m always eager to learn and take on new challenges, both in software and life.
- My favorite piece of technology is Docker â€” it's the closest thing to magic for me.
- I enjoy diving into philosophical debates on almost any topic. Try me.
