# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software developer with about 3 years of experience, specializing in backend development. My journey started with mobile development using Flutter, then expanded into full-stack development, working on EU-backed projects. Currently, I'm a backend developer at [DoluSoft](https://github.com/dolusoft).

### What I Do
- Backend development is my strong suitâ€”it's where I feel most at home, solving complex software problems and building efficient systems.
- I have experience in full-stack development and mobile apps but naturally gravitate towards backend engineering.
- I love seeing my work come to life, especially when building systems that enable others to be more productive.
- I enjoy using Linux, breaking it, and fixing it again. I take the same approach to learningâ€”I like to break and rebuild something before making it better.
- I always strive to write clean and concise code, following best practices to ensure maintainability and efficiency.
- I believe that a good project is partly about code but mostly about solid architecture.
- I see programming languages as toolsâ€”what matters most is how they are used to solve problems effectively.
- I have experience working in enterprise projects in all shapes and sizes.
- I love working with other peopleâ€”teamwork indeed makes the dream work.
- I enjoy mentoring interns and junior developers, helping them grow in their careers.

### Technologies & Skills
- Strong experience and preference with C# and OOP languages.
- Worked with message brokers such as Redis and relational databases.
- Familiar with Docker and deployment processes.
- Experience in basic infrastructure maintenance, including server setups and management.

### Interests
- Sci-fi and technology have always been my passions, and I love exploring new advancements in both fields.
- Iâ€™m always eager to learn and tackle new challenges in software development.
